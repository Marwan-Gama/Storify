```

## 📝 Test Organization

### Test Structure

```
describe("Complete File Operations E2E Tests", () => {
  // Setup and teardown
  beforeAll() - Create test user and folder
  afterAll() - Cleanup all test data
  beforeEach() - Clean files before each test

  // Test suites organized by functionality
  describe("File Upload Operations", () => { ... })
  describe("File Retrieval Operations", () => { ... })
  describe("File Download Operations", () => { ... })
  describe("File Preview Operations", () => { ... })
  describe("File Update Operations", () => { ... })
  describe("File Copy Operations", () => { ... })
  describe("File Delete and Restore Operations", () => { ... })

  describe("Public File Operations", () => { ... })
  describe("Error Handling and Edge Cases", () => { ... })
  describe("File Type and Size Validation", () => { ... })
})
```

### Best Practices

1. **Independent Tests**: Each test runs independently
