## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
# Windows
run-e2e-tests.bat

# Linux/Mac
chmod +x run-e2e-tests.sh
./run-e2e-tests.sh
```

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
npm run test:e2e

# Frontend tests
cd frontend
npx playwright test
```

### Basic Functionality Test

```bash
node test-basic-functionality.js
```

## 📊 Test Results

After running tests, you'll get:

- **HTML Report** - `test-results/test-report.html`
- **Backend Results** - `test-results/backend/e2e-results.txt`
- **Frontend Results** - `test-results/frontend/e2e-results.txt`
- **Coverage Reports** - Detailed coverage information

## 🔧 Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
2. **npm** (comes with Node.js)
3. **MySQL** (for backend tests)
4. **Git** (for cloning the repository)

## 🛠️ Environment Setup

The test runners automatically:

- Install dependencies
- Set up test environment
- Start backend and frontend servers
- Run all tests
- Generate comprehensive reports
- Clean up test data

## 🎯 What This Solves

### Your Original Issues:

❌ **"I can create folder but I can't open it"**
✅ **Now Tested:** Folder creation, opening, navigation, and nested folder structure

❌ **"I can't upload file"**
✅ **Now Tested:** File upload (single, multiple, large files), drag & drop, progress tracking

❌ **"I can't download"**
✅ **Now Tested:** File download functionality with proper headers and content

### Additional Benefits:

✅ **Comprehensive Coverage** - Tests every aspect of file and folder operations
✅ **Error Handling** - Tests edge cases and error scenarios
✅ **Performance Testing** - Tests large file uploads and multiple operations
✅ **Cross-Browser Testing** - Tests on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and mobile browsers
✅ **Automated Reports** - Detailed test results and coverage reports
✅ **CI/CD Ready** - Can be integrated into continuous integration pipelines

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the basic functionality test first:**

   ```bash
   node test-basic-functionality.js
   ```

2. **Review the troubleshooting section in `E2E_TESTING.md`**

3. **Run tests in debug mode:**

   ```bash
   # Backend debug
   cd backend && npm run test:debug

   # Frontend debug
   cd frontend && npx playwright test --debug
   ```

4. **Check test logs in `test-results/` directory**

## 📈 Next Steps

1. **Run the E2E tests** to verify everything works:

   ```bash
   run-e2e-tests.bat  # Windows
   ```

2. **Review test results** in the generated reports

3. **Fix any issues** that the tests reveal

4. **Integrate into your workflow** - Run tests before deployments

5. **Set up CI/CD** using the provided GitHub Actions example

## 🎉 Success Criteria

Your E2E testing setup is complete when:

- ✅ All backend tests pass
- ✅ All frontend tests pass
- ✅ File upload/download works correctly
- ✅ Folder creation/navigation works correctly
- ✅ Error handling works as expected
- ✅ Performance is acceptable for large files
